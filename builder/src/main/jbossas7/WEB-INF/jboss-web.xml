        Use by default the JBoss AS security domain.
        In order to access as superuser to the Dashboard Builder app you must create a user with login="root".
        (Users can be registered using the bin/add-user.sh command)

        If you choose to use a custom security domain then you should define it into the
        <jboss-as7>/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml file.
